The authors do not guarantee that any script or workflow will achieve a particular outcome, integrate with your environment or be compatible with your versions of Windows, Python, libraries, Office or third party services.

Assumption of risk  
You assume all risks associated with using the code. Always use test data first, keep backups and review any actions that create, modify, move or delete files. Validate paths, filters and parameters before running scripts on important data.
